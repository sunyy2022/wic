                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Shanghai, an iconic East Asian city, is a dynamic blend of past and present.

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="getting-there">Getting There and Away</h2>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Air</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Shanghai has two major airports. Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) is the main international gateway, offering flights to destinations globally. Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) mainly operates domestic flights, with some short-haul international ones. Airlines from different countries land at these airports, facilitating international travel.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Train</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The city has four major railway stations: Shanghai Railway Station, Shanghai South Railway Station, Shanghai West Railway Station, and Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station. All are well-connected to the metro. Shanghai is linked to other Chinese cities by high-speed railways like the Beijing–Shanghai HSR, Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai–Kunming HSR, and Shanghai–Nantong railway.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Sea</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cruising to Shanghai is an option. Many cruise lines include it as a port of call. Cruise ships dock at the port in Pudong district, from where you can easily access the city.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="getting-around">Getting Around Shanghai</h2>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Metro</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Shanghai Metro is a convenient and efficient way to get around. It covers most parts of the city. You can purchase single-trip tickets at metro station ticket vending machines. Additionally, using a Shanghai Transportation Card is more convenient. The card can be topped up at stations and is widely accepted. You can also pay via mobile payment apps like Alipay or WeChat Pay at the ticket gates in many stations.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Bus</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Shanghai has an extensive bus system with nearly a thousand lines. Bus fares are usually around ¥2. To pay, you can use cash, but it's better to have the exact amount. Mobile payment via Alipay or WeChat Pay is also available on most buses. Just scan the QR code on the bus payment device. However, be aware that traffic congestion during peak hours may slow down the journey.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Taxi / Ride-hailing</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Taxis are easily available in Shanghai. They are metered, and the fare depends on distance and waiting time. Make sure the driver uses the meter. You can hail a taxi on the street or find them at taxi stands outside major public places. Besides traditional taxis, ride-hailing services are also popular. You can use apps like Didi Chuxing to book a ride. The fare is calculated based on the app's algorithm.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Ferry</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The ferry service across the Huangpu River offers great views of the city skyline, especially of the Bund and Lujiazui. It's both a means of transportation and a tourist experience. There are 17 ferry lines serving nearly 40 stations. Commonly used lines for tourists include Nan Lu, Dong Fu, and Dongjin. Stations offer self-service ticketing (Alipay, WeChat Pay, Transportation Card, cash).</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Cycling</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cycling is popular in areas with dedicated bike lanes. You can rent a bike from bike-sharing services like Meituan Bike and Hello Bike using their apps. Not all areas allow cycling; use map apps (Baidu, Google) to check routes and find bike locations.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="attractions">Famous Attractions</h2>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">The Bund</h3>
