                                        Most tourists need a tourist (L - type) visa. Apply at the Chinese embassy or consulate in your home country. Prepare a filled-out form, valid passport, photo, and sometimes proof of accommodation and travel plans.

                                        Chinese cuisine uses a lot of ingredients that might be uncommon abroad, such as various types of offal. Dishes like pork liver stir-fry or duck blood soup are popular. If you have allergies, make sure to communicate clearly with the waitstaff. Use translation apps to show your allergy list in Chinese.

                                        A simple handshake is common, but in formal settings, a slight nod is also appropriate. When visiting someone's home, it's polite to bring a small gift, like fruits or a box of Chinese tea.

If using a foreign SIM card with international roaming, dial +86 before these numbers. Even without a SIM card, most phones can make emergency calls as long as there's network coverage.
