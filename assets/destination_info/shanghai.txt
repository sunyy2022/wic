Shanghai: A City of Contrasts

Shanghai, an iconic East Asian city, is a dynamic blend of past and present.  In the 19th century, it grew into a key trading port, welcoming international commerce and cultures.  This led to a unique aesthetic, with Western architecture melding with traditional Chinese elements.  Today, Shanghai is China's economic powerhouse and a global financial center.  Its skyline of skyscrapers showcases its modern, innovative status.  It serves as a hub for international business, hosting multinationals and world-class events.    

Culturally, Shanghai offers a rich mix.  Deeply rooted in Chinese traditions, it also embraces contemporary global trends.  Here, old-world customs coexist with avant-garde art, music, and fashion.  With a well-developed transport and diverse accommodations, Shanghai attracts travelers worldwide, offering an experience that captures China's past and present allure.    

Getting There and Away

By Air

Shanghai has two major airports.  Shanghai Pudong International Airport is the main international gateway, offering flights to destinations globally.  Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights, with some short-haul international ones.  Airlines from different countries land at these airports, facilitating international travel.    

By Train

The city has four major railway stations: Shanghai Railway Station, Shanghai South Railway Station, Shanghai West Railway Station, and Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station.  All are well-connected to the metro.  Shanghai is linked to other Chinese cities by high-speed railways like the Beijing–Shanghai HSR, Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai–Kunming HSR, and Shanghai–Nantong railway.    

By Sea

Cruising to Shanghai is an option.  Many cruise lines include it as a port of call.  Cruise ships dock at the port in Pudong district, from where you can easily access the city.    

Getting Around Shanghai

Metro

The Shanghai Metro is a convenient and efficient way to get around.  It covers most parts of the city.  You can purchase single-trip tickets at metro station ticket vending machines.  Additionally, using a Shanghai Transportation Card is more convenient.  The card can be topped up at stations and is widely accepted.  You can also pay via mobile payment apps like Alipay or WeChat Pay at the ticket gates in many stations.    

Bus

Shanghai has an extensive bus system with nearly a thousand lines.  Bus fares are usually around ¥2.  To pay, you can use cash, but it's better to have the exact amount.  Mobile payment via Alipay or WeChat Pay is also available on most buses.  Just scan the QR code on the bus payment device.  However, be aware that traffic congestion during peak hours may slow down the journey.    

Taxi

Taxis are easily available in Shanghai.  They are metered, and the fare depends on distance and waiting time.  Make sure the driver uses the meter.  You can hail a taxi on the street or find them at taxi stands outside major public places such as airports, railway stations, and shopping malls.  Besides traditional taxis, ride-hailing services are also popular in Shanghai.  You can use apps like Didi Chuxing to book a ride.  Some international ride-hailing apps may also be available in certain areas.  The fare for ride-hailing services is calculated based on the app's algorithm, usually considering distance, time, and peak-hour surcharges.    

Ferry

The ferry service across the Huangpu River offers great views of the city skyline, especially of the Bund and Lujiazui.  It's both a means of transportation and a tourist experience.  There are 17 ferry lines in total, serving nearly 40 ferry stations along both sides of the Huangpu River.  Some commonly used ferry lines for tourists include the Nan Lu line, Dong Fu line, and Dongjin line.  For example, the Nan Lu line has ferry stations at 1, Lujiabang Rd.  on the Puxi side (operating from 04:50 - 23:10) and 2, Nanmatou Rd.  on the Pudong side (operating from 04:40 - 23:20).  All ferry stations offer self-service ticketing, and you can pay by Alipay, WeChat Pay, Shanghai Public Transportation Card, or cash.    

Cycling

Cycling is popular in areas with dedicated bike lanes.  You can rent a bike from bike-sharing services.  Well-known bike-sharing brands in Shanghai include Meituan Bike and Hello Bike.  To use them, download the corresponding apps, register, and scan the QR code on the bike to unlock it.  However, not all areas in Shanghai allow cycling.  Use a map app like Baidu Maps or Google Maps to check for bike-friendly routes.  These apps can also show you where bike-sharing stations are located for easy bike pick-up and drop-off.

For the early part of this phase, wear long-sleeved shirts, light sweaters, and a wind-resistant jacket. As it warms up a bit, you can swap the jacket for a light cardigan.
