                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Air</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beijing is served by two major international airports: Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport. You can find direct flights to Beijing from many cities worldwide. To travel between the city center and the airports, you have several convenient options: airport shuttle buses, taxis, or the subway.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Train</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">China's extensive railway network connects Beijing to other cities across the country, with both high-speed and regular trains. High-speed trains are a popular choice for long-distance travel, offering speed and comfort. Ticket prices for high-speed trains vary depending on your destination and the class of seat you choose. For example, a second-class seat from Beijing to Shanghai costs approximately 550 yuan, while a second-class seat from Beijing to Xi'an costs around 515 yuan. You can purchase tickets online through the official 12306 website (<a href="http://www.12306.cn/en" target="_blank">http://www.12306.cn/en</a>) or at ticket windows in train stations. Keep in mind that high-speed train tickets go on sale two weeks before the departure date. It's advisable to book your tickets in advance, especially during peak travel seasons like holidays.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Getting Around Beijing</h2>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Subway/Bus</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beijing boasts a comprehensive subway network, making it easy to navigate the city. For convenient travel on both the subway and buses, consider using the Alipay transportation code. The bus system is also a convenient option, and you can use map apps like Baidu Maps or Gaode Maps (both offer English-language interfaces) to plan your routes.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">Taxi/Ride-hailing</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">You can hail taxis on the street, or use ride-hailing apps (such as Didi or Gaode Maps, the Chinese equivalent of Uber) to book a ride. Ride-hailing apps are generally recommended to avoid misunderstandings about your destination and to help ensure the driver takes the most direct route. However, be aware that traffic congestion can be heavy during morning and evening rush hours.</p>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">The Forbidden City (The Palace Museum)</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, is the largest and most complete ancient palace complex in the world. It offers a glimpse into the opulence and grandeur of China's imperial past. Located at the heart of Beijing's central axis, it served as the imperial palace for the Ming and Qing dynasties. Its construction began in 1406 and was completed in 1420.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Great Wall is a world-renowned wonder and a symbol of China's strength and resilience. Its history dates back to the Warring States Period, when the State of Yan first built fortifications to defend against invaders. During the Qin Dynasty, these walls were connected and expanded, including the sections now within the Beijing municipality. Today, the most visited sections are primarily remnants from the Ming Dynasty, such as the Badaling and Mutianyu sections.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Summer Palace, originally built in 1750 during the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty and initially named "Qingyi Garden," is a sprawling imperial garden. Situated at No. 19, Xinjian Gongmen Road, Haidian District, Beijing, it covers an area of 3.009 square kilometers. Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake are its central features, creating a harmonious blend of natural beauty and imperial architecture. The Summer Palace is recognized as one of China's Four Great Gardens, alongside the Mountain Resort in Chengde, the Humble Administrator’s Garden, and the Lingering Garden. In 1998, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hutongs, the traditional alleyways of Beijing, are the city's historical veins, preserving its rich history and culture. These narrow lanes, lined with siheyuan (traditional courtyard houses), began to take shape during the Yuan Dynasty. The architectural details of the hutongs, such as the door piers and screen walls, showcase the charm of traditional Chinese culture.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Peking Opera is a cherished traditional art form that embodies the essence of Chinese theatrical performance. It combines singing, recitation, acting, and martial arts, characterized by elaborate costumes, distinctive facial makeup, and captivating performances. With a vast repertoire of historical dramas, mythological legends, and more, Peking Opera offers a fascinating glimpse into Chinese storytelling and artistry.
