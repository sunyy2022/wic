                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When traveling in China, it's crucial to know the emergency phone numbers and how to reach out for help in case of unexpected situations. Here's a guide to help you stay safe.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Commonly Used Emergency Phone Numbers</h2>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3 mt-4">110 - Police Emergency</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This number is for all kinds of police-related emergencies. Whether you encounter a crime, need assistance in a dangerous situation, or have lost your belongings and suspect theft, calling 110 is the first step. The police will respond as quickly as possible to provide help and ensure your safety.</p>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3 mt-4">120 - Medical Emergency</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In case of any medical emergencies, such as sudden illness, injury, or if someone around you is in need of immediate medical attention, dial 120. Trained medical professionals will be dispatched to the location you provide. They are equipped to handle various medical situations, from minor injuries to life-threatening conditions.</p>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3 mt-4">119 - Fire and Rescue</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When there's a fire, a gas leak, or any situation that requires fire-fighting or rescue services, 119 is the number to call. Firefighters will rush to the scene with the necessary equipment to extinguish the fire and rescue people in danger.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to Dial These Numbers</h2>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3 mt-4">Using a Chinese SIM Card</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If you are using a local Chinese SIM card in your mobile phone, simply dial the three-digit emergency numbers (110, 120, or 119) directly from your phone's dial pad. It's as straightforward as making any other local call.</p>

                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3 mt-4">Using a Foreign SIM Card</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When using a foreign SIM card with international roaming enabled in China, the process is a bit different. First, you need to dial the international access code for China, which is <strong>+86</strong>. Then, dial the emergency number without the leading 0. For example, to call the police, you would dial <strong>+86110</strong>. Some mobile phones may automatically add the + sign when you press and hold the 0 key. Make sure your phone has sufficient credit or is on a plan that allows international calls in China. If you are not sure whether your foreign SIM card can make emergency calls in China, it's a good idea to check with your home telecom carrier before your trip.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In some cases, especially in areas with poor network coverage, you may still be able to get emergency services even if you don't have an active SIM card in your phone. Most mobile phones are designed to allow emergency calls without a SIM card as long as there is a signal from any network available.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4 mt-5"><strong>Remember:</strong> In an emergency, stay calm and clearly communicate your location and the nature of the problem to the operator on the other end of the line. Knowing these emergency phone numbers and how to use them can make a significant difference in ensuring a safe and enjoyable trip in China.</p>
