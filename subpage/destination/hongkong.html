                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) is a major aviation hub, offering flights to destinations across the globe. Numerous international airlines operate here, ensuring convenient access for travelers. The airport also provides extensive facilities, including shopping, dining, and lounges.</p>
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-3">By Train</h3>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link provides a direct connection to mainland China.

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="getting-around">Getting Around Hong Kong</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Hong Kong boasts an excellent public transportation system, making it easy to navigate the city.</p>

You can hail taxis on the street or find them at taxi stands outside major transport hubs and hotels. Ride-hailing apps like HKTaxi are also available.</p>

The Star Ferry is particularly popular for its iconic harbor crossings between Central (Hong Kong Island) and Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon), and between Wan Chai (Hong Kong Island) and Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon). Ferries operated by New World First Ferry serve the outlying islands, such as Cheung Chau, Mui Wo, and Peng Chau. You can pay with an Octopus Card or purchase tickets at the ferry terminal. Ferry terminals are conveniently located near major tourist attractions.</p>
