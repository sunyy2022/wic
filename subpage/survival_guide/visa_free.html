                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Planning a trip to China? Understanding the visa requirements is crucial. While most travelers need a visa, China offers several visa-free policies that might apply to you, making your travel planning simpler.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">1. 144-Hour Visa-Free Transit</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This is one of the most popular options. Citizens from 53 specific countries can enjoy a 144-hour (6 days) visa-free transit period when transiting through designated Chinese ports to a third country or region (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan).</p>
                                    <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                        <li><strong>Eligible Countries:</strong> Includes most European countries (Schengen Area, UK, Ireland, Russia, etc.), USA, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, UAE, Qatar.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Designated Ports:</strong> Major airports like Beijing Capital (PEK), Beijing Daxing (PKX), Shanghai Pudong (PVG), Shanghai Hongqiao (SHA), Guangzhou Baiyun (CAN), Chengdu Shuangliu (CTU), Kunming Changshui (KMG), Shenzhen Bao'an (SZX), Xiamen Gaoqi (XMN), Hangzhou Xiaoshan (HGH), and more, as well as some seaports and railway ports.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Valid passport, confirmed onward ticket to a third country/region within 144 hours, and a valid visa for the third country/region if required.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Permitted Area:</strong> You are usually restricted to stay within the administrative area of the entry city/province (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Shanghai-Jiangsu-Zhejiang region, Guangdong province).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">2. 24-Hour Visa-Free Transit</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Most foreign nationals transiting through China by air can stay for up to 24 hours without a visa, provided they hold a confirmed onward ticket to a third country/region. You generally must stay within the airport transit area, but depending on the airport and duration, you might be able to apply for a temporary entry permit to leave the airport.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">3. Visa Exemption for Specific Nationalities (Short Stays)</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">China has bilateral agreements with some countries allowing their citizens visa-free entry for tourism or business for short periods (typically 15, 30, 60, or 90 days). Notable examples include:</p>
                                    <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                        <li><strong>Singapore, Brunei, Japan (suspended):</strong> Ordinary passport holders could previously enter visa-free for up to 15 days (Japan's policy is currently suspended).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Recent Unilateral Visa-Free Entry (Trial):</strong> China recently implemented a trial unilateral visa-free policy for ordinary passport holders from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Malaysia for stays up to 15 days for business, tourism, visiting relatives, and transit (valid until November 30, 2024). This has been extended to Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg (valid until December 31, 2025).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Other Agreements:</strong> Countries like Ecuador, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Qatar, UAE, Armenia, Albania, etc., have varying visa exemption agreements.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Important:</strong> These policies change. Always verify the latest requirements with the official Chinese embassy or consulate in your country before traveling.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">4. Hainan Province 30-Day Visa-Free Access</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Citizens from 59 countries can visit Hainan Province visa-free for up to 30 days if they book their tour through a Hainan-based travel agency. Eligible countries include those mentioned in the 144-hour transit policy plus others like Monaco, Indonesia, Philippines, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, etc.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">5. Pearl River Delta (Guangdong) 6-Day Visa-Free Visit for Tour Groups</h2>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Tour groups organized by travel agencies registered in Hong Kong or Macau, consisting of nationals from countries with diplomatic relations with China, can visit the Pearl River Delta region (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, etc.) visa-free for up to 6 days, provided they enter from Hong Kong or Macau and travel together as a group.</p>

                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Key Considerations</h2>
                                    <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                        <li><strong>Third Country Rule:</strong> For transit policies, you must be traveling from Country A -> China -> Country C. Returning to Country A (e.g., USA -> Shanghai -> USA) does not qualify. Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are considered separate regions for this purpose.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Official Sources:</strong> Visa policies can change rapidly. Always consult the official website of the Chinese Embassy or Consulate in your country or the National Immigration Administration of China for the most current information.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Remember that foreigners must register their accommodation with the local police station within 24 hours of arrival (hotels usually do this automatically, but it's required if staying with friends/family or in an Airbnb).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Understanding these visa-free options can save you time and money. Research carefully based on your nationality, itinerary, and port of entry to see if you qualify.</p>
