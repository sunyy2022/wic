                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Beijing Opera, also known as Peking Opera (京剧, Jīngjù), is the most dominant form of Chinese opera, combining music, vocal performance, mime, dance, and acrobatics. It arose in Beijing in the mid-Qing dynasty (1644–1912) and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century.</p>

                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Singing:</strong> Beijing Opera features a diverse array of singing styles. Performers use high-pitched, clear, and powerful vocals to convey a wide spectrum of emotions and portray various characters. For instance, the "xipi" and "erhuang" melodies are fundamental, each with its own unique characteristics. The singing can range from slow and melodious to express sadness to fast-paced and energetic to depict excitement.</p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><strong>Acting:</strong> Acting in Beijing Opera is highly stylized. Actors employ exaggerated gestures, facial expressions, and postures to tell stories and vividly depict a variety of characters, from noble emperors to brave warriors and graceful ladies. Even a simple flick of a sleeve can convey complex emotions such as anger, disappointment, or elegance.</p>
